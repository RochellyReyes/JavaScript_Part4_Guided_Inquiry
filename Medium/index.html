    <h1>Medium Challenge</h1>
    <h2>Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
    You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
    You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
    </h2>
    <p>
    Hint:  Use a function. Use the built in method .indexOf( ) and/or  for loops. Review your lesson on Arrays to aid in working through this problem. 
    </p>
    <ul>Examples:
        <li>Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
        </li>
        <li>Output: 4
        </li>
        <li>Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
        </li>
        <li>Output: -1
        </li>
    </ul>
